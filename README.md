## User Requirements and Expectations 

The website feature both visual and written content with interactive elements. Feedback will be give to the user whenever they make a decision and there will be clear descriptions of how to play the game. The web content will be structured into different webpages that display appropriate information to the user. There will be social links in the footer for the user to visit. 

The dungeon maze is a great website for this as it give good feedback to the user through the use of alerts on larger screens and outputting text into a div to display alerts users on smaller screens where alerts are disabled. The webpages contents follow a nice structured flow. Creating a nice pathways for the users to follow.

---

## Design Choices 

---

### Colors:

![colours](img/readme-img/dungeon-maze-color-scheme.jpg)

I used this colour palette on the site. The colors from this pallete came from the images I generated. I also used colour which I thought contrasted well with the other colours such as whites and blacks. 

---
### Fonts

![fonts](img/readme-img/dungeon-maze-font.jpg)

I used the google font Press Start 2P across the website. I decided to use this font for both the titles and 
then other text to keep consistency and because it built upon the retro style that I wanted to create. Another reason was that the font was easily readable in smaller sizes. 

---
### Imagery

The images for the website were created using an online ai art generation tool. I chose to use the image title dungeon maze title image because it was the most unique image that I generated. Injecting a unique fantasy feeling to the site to try and get an get an emotional response from the user when they first land on the site. The emotion I wanted to capture was nustalia. The other images that are on the site in the generated image section were created using the same approch as the hero image. I matched the images to the text descriptions to create a nice flow of written and visual information and so that the images displayed made sense visually as to what the text was descibing. I took quite a loose approch to this on some of the images. However, this was to create a retro/unique feeling and because of what the ai art genertor created.
I used a blurred effect on the background image to create a reto game effect whist keeping the other images to a more modern high quality. 

---
### Styling 

All the containers on the site are set to be fluid so that they cover the screen size. Which creates a more modern look than other retro games, were the game is in a normal container. The area behind the images was set to black to emulate a small screen. The information given to the user in all areas follows the format of image then written information so that the image is the first piece of information the user sees. On smaller screens an output area was created in order for the user to be given feedback from the game. Javascript alerts replace this on larger screens. The buttons are colour cordinated so that the user can see which buttons can be pressed at different stages of the game. The how to play modal is styled to contrast with the rest of game. Finally the images and text areas use a fade animation to try and emulate the effect older stlye games used to have when they loaded.

## WireFrames: 

![wireframe](img/readme-img/dungeon-maze-wireframe.jpg)

---
## Features: 

### Current Features:

### Navbar 

![navbar](img/readme-img/dungeon-maze-navbar.jpg)
- The navbar includes the links to all the different pages on the site and a logo which links to the home page
- On smaller screens the navbar collapses behind a burger icon making it responsive across screen sizes
- The navbar has a modal built into the how to play link which gives users accurate descriptions of how to play the game without having to leave the page they're on. 
- The navbar for this site is not fixed to the top of the page to save screen space and because the site doesn't have much vertical content
### Footer 

![footer](img/readme-img/dungeon-maze-footer.png)
- The footer includes links to external sources in particluar social media links that all open on seperate web tabs
- The footer is responsive across all screen sizes 
### Hero Image

![hero-image](img/readme-img/dungeon-maze-hero-image.jpg)
- creates an emotional resonsive of wonder and nostalgia when the user first lands on the site because of the nature of the image and the contrast with the retro background.
- Is responsive across all devices
### User Form 

![user-form](img/readme-img/dungeon-maze-form-input.jpg)
- The form element on the site allows the user to access the game page through interacting with the input and submitting their name
- Uses local storage to validate input information and store the users name. This later results in the user recieving an alert message when they enter the game. 
- The form is responsve accross all device sizes
### Reset Button

![reset-button](img/readme-img/dungeon-maze-reset-button.jpg)
- The reset button resets all the game areas and game js ready for the user to start over
- Is responsive across all device sizes 
### Small screen text output area and alerts 

![small-screen-output-and-health-inventory-areas](img/readme-img/dungeon-maze-smallscreen-and-health-inventory-areas.jpg)
- The small screen text output area works as a way of dispalying alerts to users who are on smaller devices or using browsers where alert messages are not supported 
- The alerts give feedback to the user based on their actions and decisions in the game
- On larger screens the small screen output is hidden. 
### Health areas and inventory area

- The health and inventory areas allow the user to see their status in the game. How many hearts they have left, how many the monster has and which items they have in their inventory. 
- The health and inventory areas are resonsive across all devices

### Gameplay buttons 

![gameplay-controlbar-buttons](img/readme-img/dungeon-maze-controlbar.jpg)
- The gameplay buttons allow the user to interact and progress in the game. The have the option of moving to the next room, drinking a potion to heal their hit points back up and attacking/blocking. 
- The buttons are colour coded to show the user which actions they can take at a certain time. For example when they go to a new room. They have to fight and beat the monster in order to progress. 

### Game image output area 

![game-image-output-area](img/readme-img/dungeon-maze-image-output.jpg)
- Outputs an image to the user that is generated and assigned with the matching output text giving them a visual decription of what's happening in the game
- When the images are generated the alt attributes are also changed for good practice and also to give an alternative discription to visually impared users
- The images are responsive across all device sizes
- Changes to reflect if they die or or when they lose the game
### Game text output area

![game-text-output-area](img/readme-img/dungeon-maze-text-output.png)
- Outputs text to the user giving them descriptions of whats happening in the game 
- Changes to reflect if they die or or when they lose the game
- Tells the user their score and rank at the end of the game 
---
### Future Features:

- Id like to add different classes for the user to select. Different classes will do more damage and have differnet abilities and vunerablitites. Such as a wizard that can do 2 damage on attacking but only has 3 life 
- Id like to add a shop so that the users can purchace upgrades for their character such as better weapons and more life 

### Naming Conventions and Structure of Files 

- All the files on the site have been named with consistency and structured into their appropriate sections 
- Names contain lowercase and no special characters 
- Javascript variables follow the format of camelsCase
- Images have been organise into different sections, the first image folder contains all the images used on the site and the nested folder contains all the images used on the readme 
- Seperate Javascript files have been created for the different webpages, constant variables have been structured into a seperate const.js file 
- Theres a seperate file for removed features that I plan to implement in the future

## Testing 

### Testing User's Stories 

#### First Time User

As a first time user, the first time I land on the site I can gain an understanding of what the website is about, I can easily navigate around the website easily and use the site on all my devices. I can play the game eaily and see how the website gives me feedback based on my input. I can do all this by: 
- Reading the description on the landing page of how to play the game 
- If i'm unsure on the controls I can visit the how to play section in the navbar
- Reading the alerts that the game gives to me when I enter my name and when I make desisions in the game on larger screens and reading the information given to me in the small screen output section
- I can see at which stage of the game i'm in and which buttons I need to press during the game through the use of colour coded buttons and the output images and text displayed to me 
- I can track my session progress when im playing the game by checking which items I have in my inventory and how much health I have left. I can also see how much heath my opponant has
- I can reset my progress if I need to 

#### Returning User

As a returning user my main focus is to replay the game and try and beat my old highscore I can do this by:
- Re entering the website and replaying the game 
- Seeing my highscore displayed to them when they first play the game and coming back onto the site to beat it(the score is displayed to the user when they beat the game or die. Future versions of the game will include a scoreboard to display the data or all users who play the game)

### Unit Testing

Unit testing done at the start of the development to ensure that the core functions worked as intended. Some of the function names have changed and there are a few functions that were added later and tested using other means like [Pythontutor](https://pythontutor.com/) but these tests helped me to build a solid foundation for the game.

---
### Browser testing 

The site has been tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Microsoft Edge

---
## Bugs 

Here are some of the bugs that I've found and fixed throughout development: 

1. Spelling error on score mapper causing it to return NAN when caluclating scores
    - Fixed by correcting spelling 
2. Potion function not adding all the hearts to the htlm screen 
    - Fixed by removing the remove potion function accidentily put in the while loop and calling the function outside the loop
3. Generate room function would cause an error in the console 
    - Error was caused becuse when the number generated was 10 there wasn't a room 10 
    - Fixed by changing the generate room function create a number between 1-9 instead

Other known bugs have been fixed and documented in commmit messages. 

---
### Bugs Left in Code:

- Sometimes the score doesn't map correctly for certain items inparticlar the gold coins.
- In chrome the website gives a violation warning when clicking the attack and block buttons because of the length of the code. I've left this in because its not an error but I wanted to mention it and so that I can refer back to this in the future
