## User Requirements and Expectations 
The website feature both visual and written content with interactive elements. Feedback will be give to the user whenever they make a decision and there will be clear descriptions of how to play the game. The web content will be structured into different webpages that display appropriate information to the user. There will be social links in the footer for the user to visit. 

The dungeon maze is a great website for this as it give good feedback to the user through the use of alerts on larger screens and outputting text into a div to display alerts users on smaller screens where alerts are disabled. The webpages contents follow a nice structured flow. Creating a nice pathways for the users to follow.

## Design Choices 

---
### Colors: 
I used this colour palette on the site. The colors from this pallete came from the images I generated. I also used colour which I thought contrasted well with the other colours such as whites and blacks. 

---
### Fonts:
 
I used the google font Press Start 2P across the website. I decided to use this font for both the titles and 
then other text to keep consistency and because it built upon the retro style that I wanted to create. Another reason was that the font was easily readable in smaller sizes. 
---
### Imagery: 

The images for the website were created using an online ai art generation tool. I then used another tool to pixalate them. I chose to use the image title dungeon maze title image because it was the most unique image that I generated. Injecting a unique fantasy feeling to the site to try and get an get an emotional response from the user when they first land on the site. The emotion I wanted to capture was nustalia. The other images that are on the site in the generated image section were created using the same approch as the hero image. I matched the images to the text descriptions to create a nice flow of written and visual information and so that the images displayed made sense visually as to what the text was descibing. I took quite a loose approch to this on some of the image. However, this was to create a retro/unique feeling and because of what the ai art genertor created. 
---
### Styling: 

All the containers on the site are set to be fluid so that they cover the screen size. Which creates a more modern look than other retro games, were the game is in a normal container. The area behind the images was set to black to emulate a small screen. The information given to the user in all areas follows the format of image then written information so that the image is the first piece of information the user sees. On smaller screens an output area was created in order for the user to be given feedback from the game. Javascript alerts replace this on larger screens. The buttons are colour cordinated so that the user can see which buttons can be pressed at different stages of the game. The how to play modal is styled to contrast with the rest of game.
